Take the language vector representing single letters of
    Alice and compute its dot product with the 26 different
    letter vectors.  Can you see a relation between the dot
    products and the letter counts in Alice?  Alice has
    about 300 instances of 'q'.  I'd expect a dot product
    with the Q-vector to be around 3 million.

Then take the language vector representing the bigrams
    of Alice and compute its dot product with QU.  What do
    you get?  And what is this language vector's dot
    product with Q?
dot product of bigrams vector and qu is -7924
Next, add the two language vectors into a single vector
    that represents both individual letters and bigrams.
    Compute its dot product with Q and with QU.  What do
    you get?

One more set of tests: Take the language vector for
    bigrams and (pointwise) multiply it with sQ (Q shifted
    once).  Compare the resulting vector (with dot product
    or cosine) to the letter vectors A, B, C, ....  Which
    letter wins?  Do the same using the language vector for
    individual letters, and once more using a language
    vector that is the sum of the above two.

So try this: make a language vector of bigrams only.
    If you test it with (calculate its dot produce with)
    the letter vectors, you should get numbers like those
    in the second block of 'results.txt' that starts with
    dot product of bigrams_sQ and a is -31528
    Some are positive, some negative, and none is in the
    hundreds of thousands.  All that is 'noise' in
    signal-processing terms.  But if you test it with the
    vector for QU (which equals sQ * U) or with any other
    bigram vector, you should get that bigram's frequency
    times 10K.  That's referred to as signal.

After you have gotten this far, make a language vector
    that combines individual letters, bigrams and trigrams:
    just add those three language vectors into a single
    vector (by normal vector addition.).  Then test it for
    single letters and bigrams as above.  Also, multiply it
    with sQ and test the result as above.  The dot products
    should be close to what you got before.

What is the dot product of the
    single-letter language vector with itself?  What is the
    dot product of the bigrams vector with itself?  What is
    the dot product of the bigrams vector with the sum of
    the the single-letter vector and the bigrams vector?
    All should be around 1.2 billion, I think.
    Some of the dot products with letter vectors are very
    large negative (-362566580680).  You could be
    multiplying vectors when you should be adding them.
