"""
We will be experimenting with two 10,000-dimensional
vocabulary vectors, (1) a Full-Words Vector and (2) a
Substrings Vector.

The Full-Words vector is the sum of L-gram vectors, one
per vocabulary word, where L is the length of the word.

The Substrings vector is a bit more challenging.  It is the
sum that includes every N-gram of every vocabulary word, but
excludes 1-grams (individual letters) of words that have 2
or more letters.  How many N-grams are there anyway in an
L-letter word?
